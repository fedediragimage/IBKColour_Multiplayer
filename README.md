## IBKColour_Multiplied
It is a multiplier node of IBKColour for IBKGizmo. It makes your script visually prettier and gives you more control over some parameters as well as having an input for masks. As described by CreativeLyons in one of his videos, using the multiplier technique, stacking multiple IBKColours results in a cleaner plate that takes into account important pixels and minimizes shadows and unwanted detail.
